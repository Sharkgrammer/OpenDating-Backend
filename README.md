# OpenDating (Backend)

OpenDating is a project designed to improve modern dating websites. 

It aims to achieve this in two ways:
1. All data (such as view and like stats) are open to the user. 
2. A robust series of interests allow a user to filter for other people with the same specific interests. 

It's built using a React frontend and a Django backend. See the code frontend [here](https://github.com/Sharkgrammer/OpenDating)
